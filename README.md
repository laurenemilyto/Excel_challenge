1.	<h2>Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?</h2>
     <br>a. There are more Kickstarter campaigns created for ****Theater and Plays**** than for any other category or subcategory.
     <br>b. Kickstarter campaigns about ****Food and Games**** have failed more often than they have succeeded.
     <br>c. ****December**** may be a month to avoid launching a new campaign on Kickstarter. From 2009 to 2017, Kickstarter campaigns failed more often in Dec on average. 

2.	<h2>What are some limitations of this dataset?</h2>
     <br>a. This is likely a <b>small sample size<b> of Kickstarter campaigns during that time period, potentially skewed towards theater campaigns.
     <br>b. <b>Economic conditions<b> influence donations, which in turn influence campaign success in turn, and are not factored into the data.
     <br>c. Campaign success here is defined as the campaign being fully funded, but there may be <b>other factors to consider<b> like number of backers, backer rewards     received, the creator’s health and wellbeing, etc.
     <br>d. Kickstarter’s product has evolved over the years, and the data does not factor in the <b>overall number of Kickstarter users<b>. Platform advertising, platform changes made and total number of users may have had an effect on campaign success as well. 

3.	<h2>What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?</h2>
     <br>a. It would be interesting to compare countries and the number of backers for successful campaigns to see which countries Kickstarter campaigns fared well in during this time period, using a bar chart.
     <br>b. It would be interesting to compare ‘campaign state’ with ‘average donation’, or a new field, ‘length of campaign’ to see if there is any relationship between those variables using a scatter plot.
