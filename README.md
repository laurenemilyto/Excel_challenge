Three insights about Kickstarter Campaigns:
a.	There are more Kickstarter campaigns created for Theater and Plays than for any other category or subcategory.
b.	Kickstarter campaigns about Food and Games fail more often than succeed. 
c.	December may be a month to avoid launching a new campaign on Kickstarter. From 2009 to 2017, Kickstarter campaigns failed more often on average in Dec. 

Limitations of the dataset:
a.	This is likely a small sample size of Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017. Data may not accurately represent each campaign category. 
b.	Economic conditions influence donations, which in turn influence campaign success in turn. This is not factored into the data.
c.	Campaign success is defined as the campaign being fully funded, however there may be other factors to consider such as the number of backers, backer rewards received, the creator’s health and wellbeing, etc.
d.	Kickstarter’s product has evolved over the years. The data does not factor in the overall number of Kickstarter users as the product has grown. Platform advertising, product changes and total number of users may have had an effect on campaign success as well. 

Other possible graphs/charts that could be used:
a.	Bar chart to visualize which campaigns fared best by country, using the number of backers.
b.	Scatter plot to see if there is any correlation between ‘campaign state’ and ‘average donation’, or ‘length of campaign’.
