1.	<h2>Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?</h2>
     <br>a. There are more Kickstarter campaigns created for Theater and Plays than for any other category or subcategory.
     <br>b. Kickstarter campaigns about Food and Games fail more often than succeed.
     <br>c. December may be a month to avoid launching a new campaign on Kickstarter. From 2009 to 2017, Kickstarter campaigns failed slightly more often in Dec on average. 

2.	<h2>What are some limitations of this dataset?</h2>
     <br>a. This is likely a sample size of Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017. It may not accurately represent each campaign category.
     <br>b. Economic conditions influence donations, which in turn influence campaign success and are not factored into the data.
     <br>c. Campaign success here is defined as the campaign being fully funded, but there may be other factors to consider like the number of backers, backer rewards received, the creator’s health and wellbeing, etc.
     <br>d. Kickstarter’s product has evolved over the years, and the data does not factor in the overall number of Kickstarter users as its success has grown. Platform advertising, product changes made and total number of users may have had an effect on campaign success as well. 

3.	<h2>What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?</h2>
     <br>a. It would be interesting to see which campaigns fared best by country, using the number of backers. This data could be visualized in a bar chart.
     <br>b. To see if there is any relationship between ‘campaign state’ and ‘average donation’, or a new field, ‘length of campaign’, a scatter plot could be used.
